abstract: This paper presents an unified approach to specify and check source code constraints supported by a static analyzer named Code Umpire. This tool was developed based on the collection and analysis of 497 problems and more than 10,000 submissions from the programming problems database of the online judge The Huxley. It was observed that student’s main difficulty is exercising the creation and use of recursive functions. In addition, this work makes a comparison with other approaches that are also supported by a static analyzer.
