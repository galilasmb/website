Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UFPE (Federal University of Pernambuco), currently under the guidance of Prof. Dr. [Paulo Henrique Monteiro Borba](https://pauloborba.cin.ufpe.br/). I hold both a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Sergipe. My professional journey encompasses various roles, including serving as the technology coordinator at COESI College. In addition to my academic pursuits, I expanded my professional experience as a substitute professor at the [UFS](https://ufs.br/). In this capacity, I actively engaged with students, contributed to the academic community, and shared my expertise in programming languages, programming marathons (specifically ICPC), algorithms, compilers, and static analysis. Moreover, I have ventured into the dynamic field of data science, assuming the role of a researcher in the domain. As a data scientist at [LAIS](https://lais.huol.ufrn.br/).
